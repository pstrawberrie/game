# Game Planning

## Gameplay Layout

How the MMORPG game should play

### Movement

Players have free movement within the game world when not in combat. The game world will be broken into zones. Every zone should have the ability to have interactable objects,

Keys used in free movement mode:

- Movement:
  - UP (default W)
  - LEFT (default A)
  - DOWN (default S)
  - RIGHT (default D)
- Interaction (NPCs, Objects, etc.):
  - Open Proximity Interaction Menu (default SPACEBAR)
- Zone (Trading, Player List, etc.)
  - Open Zone Menu (Z)

Free Movement Zone Types:

- Standard Zones

  - characters can freely walk around

- Flight Zones

  - characters must be in vehicles to be in these zones

- Structure Zones

  - combat structures (towers, dungeons, etc.)
  - public structures
  - player-owned structures (houses, shops, guild halls, etc.)

### Inventory

Players will have inventory and management. All variations of inventories will have search functionality.

1. Player Inventory (available anywhere)
2. Backpack Inventory (must have backpack equipped, items can be added to/removed from backpack)
3. Structure Inventory (available in owned structures)

### Character Progression

Will combine several different progression styles from popular games.

- Valheim-style character progression / "learn as you do": performing actions will gain experience for that action (ie. attacking with fists will give unarmed xp, crafting will give crafting xp, etc.)
- Star Wars Galaxies style character progression: set amount of skill points that can be spent on different professions and skills within those professions (non-linear/mix-and-match skill system).
- Players can choose 1 meta-specialization for solo play and 1 meta-specialization for group play: Looter (gets better loot), Slapper (does more damage to PvE), Angel (does more heals to party members), Puller (can pull 1-3 PvE monsters to them), more to come

### Combat

- Combat system will mirror XCOM 2 or Final Fantasy Tactics: turn-based combat with tile movement.
- Combat will comprise of both PvE and PvP.
- Combat will be initiated in Free Movement mode by colliding with the combatant (pokemon-style) or by using a special skill (ie. pull a combatant towards you)
